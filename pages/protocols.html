          <li>Cleaning the glass plate<br>
            Hold the glass plate firmly with one hand and gently scrub it with the other hand with a little washing
            powder. Rinse with tap water after scrubbing both sides, then rinse with distilled water and leave to dry in
            the basket.

              <li>Preparation of the separating glue and glue concentrate: Configure 12% of the separating glue and 5%
                of the glue concentrate in the order and proportion of the solutions in the table below.

                When there is a fold line between the water and the glue, the glue has set. Wait 3 min for the gum to
                solidify before pouring off the top layer of water and blotting up the water with absorbent paper.
              </li>
              <li>Rinse the gel concentrate with water and place it in the electrophoresis bath. (Small glass plate
                facing inwards, large glass plate facing outwards. If you are running only one piece of glue, the other
                side of the tank should be padded with a plastic plate and the side with the letters should face
                outwards.)
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Electrophoresis<br>
            After the sample is added, cover the top lid, connect the electrophoresis instrument, turn on the switch of
            the electrophoresis instrument, control the voltage at 100-200V before the sample enters the glue, about
            15-20min; after the bromophenol blue indicator in the sample reaches the separation glue, the voltage rises
            to 200V, keep the voltage stable during electrophoresis. The electrophoresis was stopped when the
            bromophenol blue indicator migrated to 1~2cm from the front, about 0.5-1hour.
          </li>
          <li>Staining and decolorization<br>
            After electrophoresis, turn off the power, take out the glass plate, pry it gently with a knife in the gap
            between the lower corners of the short and long glass plates to separate the adhesive surface from one glass
            plate, then gently lift the film, insert a copper wire in the center of the indicator zone as a marker and
            put it into a large petri dish for staining, using 0.25% Kormas Brilliant Blue staining solution, stain for
            2-4h, or overnight if necessary.
            Discard the staining solution and rinse the gel surface several times with distilled water, then add
            decolorizing solution and perform diffusion decolorization, changing the decolorizing solution frequently
            until the protein band is clear.
